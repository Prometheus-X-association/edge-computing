# Swagger generated server

## Overview
This server was generated by the [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) project. By using the
[OpenAPI-Spec](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-core/wiki) from a remote server, you can easily generate a server stub.  This
is an example of building a swagger-enabled Flask server.

This example uses the [Connexion](https://github.com/zalando/connexion) library on top of Flask.

## Requirements
Python 3.5.2+ (~= Python 3.8.20)

## Usage
To run the server, please execute the following from the root directory:

```bash
$ python3.8 -m pip install -U -r requirements.txt
$ python3.8 -m swagger_server
```

and open your browser to here:

```
http://localhost:8080/ui/
```

Your Swagger definition lives here:

```
http://localhost:8080/openapi.json
```

To prepare the integration tests, install tox:
```bash
$ python3.8 -m pip install tox
```

and launch it:
```bash
$ tox
```

## Running with Docker

To run the server on a Docker container, please execute the following from the root directory:

```bash
# building the image
docker build -t ptx-edge-api:0.0.1 .

# starting up a container
docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 -it ptx-edge-api:0.0.1
```
