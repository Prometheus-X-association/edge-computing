The Edge Computing (Decentralized AI processing) BB provides value-added services exploiting an underlying distributed edge computing infrastructure (e.g. owned and operated by Cloud Providers).

Two main high-level objectives are targeted by these services: 
  - goal 1: privacy-preserving: keep the data close to the user, more exactly within a pre-defined privacy zone
  - goal 2: efficient near-data processing: optimize performance and resource utilization


## Technical usage scenarios & Features


<!---
_Brief summary of use cases and features.
See "BB info for use cases (WP2)" spreadsheet._
--->

In general, the main goal is to move the processing functions close to the data, and execute them on-site. If the execution capability is available in the node storing the data, the processing function (FaaS based operation) or container (CaaS based operation) is launched there (e.g. by the Kubernetes/Knative platform). By these means, we can avoid the transmission of a large amount of data. (goal 2)

As a more realistic use case, the data is also moved but only within a pre-defined privacy zone. This privacy zone encompasses worker nodes (using Kubernetes terminology) where we can deploy the processing functions on demand. (goal 1)


### Features/main functionalities
<!--
_In-depth description of BB features (details).
Again, an enumeration (ie bullet points) is useful. Take input from description for WP2_
-->

  - control the placement of data: keep within pre-defined privacy zones
  - only trustworthy infrastructure is used for data processing
    - trustworthy: contract needed between Data Provider and Cloud Provider
  - efficient (green) operation: minimizing data transfers if near-data / on-site processing is available
  - moving the processing functions / containers dynamically 

### Technical usage scenarios
<!--
_In-depth description of the use cases of the BB.
Explain why would one want to use this BB.
What services, features does it offer, why these are useful.
A bullet point list is recommended._
-->

#### scenario 0: set up infrastructure
  - Launch VMs spanning across multiple Cloud Providers infrastructure via IaaS
  - Deploy Kubernetes cluster to the VMs
  - Worker nodes / edge sites metadata includes Cloud Provider info
    - to be able to check privacy-zone memberships
  - Perform optional configurations (e.g. CNI, Istio for tenant isolation)
  - Tailor-made Kubernetes/Knative scheduler controls placement decisions (data, function/container)

#### scenario 1: privacy-preserving AI processing
  - General BB triggers a processing function on Data A
    - Input: processing reference to thee function (or container), Data A to be processed
  - privacy zone of Data A is determined
    - based on metadata gained from the Data Provider via Connector (PDC)
  - privacy zones of worker nodes / edge sites are determined
  - tailor-made Kubernetes/Knative scheduler selects the worker node(s) / edge site(s) within the privacy zone
  - processing function is gathered via the Connector (from the Catalog)
  - processing function is deployed to the selected worker node(s) (Edge Site 1)
    - option 1: container (CaaS)
    - option 2: function (FaaS)
  - Data A is moved to Edge Site 1 via the Connector (PDC)
    - privacy-preserving data sharing is requested
  - processing function is executed on Data A at Edge Site 1
  - result is provided
  - Data A is deleted at Edge Site 1
  - processing function / container is destroyed at Edge Site 1

#### scenario 2: efficient near-data processing
  - General BB triggers a processing function on Data A
    - Input: reference to the processing function (or container), Data A to be processed
    - Precondition: worker node is "collocated" with Data A (Data A is directly available from the worker node)
  - tailor-made Kubernetes/Knative scheduler selects the worker node (Edge Site 1) collocated with Data A
  - processing function is gathered via the Connector (from the Catalog)
  - processing function is deployed to Edge Site 1
    - option 1: container (CaaS)
    - option 2: function (FaaS)
  - processing function is executed on Data A at Edge Site 1
  - result is provided
  - processing function / container is destroyed at Edge Site 1


## Requirements

<!---
_High-level BB requirements with identifiers.
eg * **R1.** BB MUST communicate with [other BB]_

_See also the Requirements spreadsheets
Functional requirements should be extended with extra-functional ones:
Timeliness (expected response time@request size), Througput (number of requess served by the BB),etc.
These may be defined later with UCs but have to be indentified here and be part of configuration/deplomyent options_

## Input / Output Data

_What data does this BB receive?
What data does this BB produce?
If possible, elaborate on the details (data format, contents, etc) and also add potential data requirements._

<!--
_Mermaid has no such feature, but you may use PlantUML to automatically visualize JSON schemata; for example:_

```plantuml
@startjson
{
   "fruit":"Apple",
   "size":"Large",
   "color": ["Red", "Green"]
}
@endjson
```

_Creating the diagram via the PlantUML JAR:_

```shell-session
$ java -jar plantuml.jar -tsvg json.puml
```

_Gives:_
